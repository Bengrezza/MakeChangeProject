## Make Change Project Cash Register

## Description:
This is my very first Java project at SD. In the cash register project we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

## What I Learned:
This project helped me to understand how to use if statements and the mathround() function to help print out specific money denominations.

## Technologies Used:
Java, Eclipse, Git
